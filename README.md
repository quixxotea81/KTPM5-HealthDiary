## Water Consumption Tracker
Stay hydrated with our water tracker! Set your daily hydration goal, and easily log each time you drink water by entering the amount in milliliters. You can even customize hydration reminders, setting the intervals for when you want to be reminded to drink water.

Never miss your bedtime again! Set your target sleep time, and we'll send you a friendly notification when it's time to wind down and get some rest. Healthy sleep is essential for a balanced lifestyle, and our app helps you stay on schedule.
